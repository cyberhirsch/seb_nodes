## ðŸ“¦ The Nodes

This collection is designed to work together to solve common workflow challenges.

### 1. Aspect Ratio (Seb)

**(Category: `utils/aspect_ratio`)**

Stop guessing your dimensions. This node intelligently calculates `width` and `height` for you, ensuring your images are perfectly sized and compatible with your models.

#### Key Features

*   **Preset Library**: A logically sorted list of common aspect ratios, from tall portrait (`9:16`) to cinematic widescreen (`21:9`).
*   **Intelligent Sizing Modes**:
    *   **Megapixels**: Set a target image complexity (e.g., `1.0` for a ~1MP image) and let the node handle the math across different shapes.
    *   **Fixed Side**: Lock in a specific width or height, and the node calculates the other dimension to match your chosen ratio.
*   **Dynamic UI**: The interface smartly hides irrelevant options to reduce clutter.
*   **Model-Safe Output**: A `multiple_of` setting ensures your final dimensions are divisible by a required number (like 8), preventing model errors.

> **Pro-Tip:** Use **Megapixels** mode when experimenting with different aspect ratios. It keeps your VRAM usage and generation time consistent, allowing for fairer comparisons between compositions.

### 2. Unified Prompter (Seb)

**(Category: `utils/prompting`)**

Build complex, high-quality prompts with an organized, modular system. This node replaces dozens of text boxes with a clean, dropdown-based interface powered by a simple, external JSON file.

#### Key Features

*   **External JSON Stylesheet**: All dropdown options are loaded from `unified_prompter_styles.json`. Add, edit, and share entire prompt libraries without ever touching the code.
*   **Categorized Modifiers**: Organize your prompt fragments into logical groups like `technique`, `composition`, `lighting`, and `artist`.
*   **Creative Roulette**: Every positive prompt category includes a **"Random"** option. Let the node surprise you with new style combinations to break creative blocks.
*   **Multi-Layered Negatives**: Stack up to three negative prompt presetsTip:** The `filename_core` input can be connected to the output of other nodes. For example, connect the `seed` number from a "Primitive" node to include the seed directly in every filename.
